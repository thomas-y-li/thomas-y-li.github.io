						Over the summer, I spent a lot of my time studying
                        for the class 21-241 Matrices and Linear Transformations,
                        and I continued to work through the textbook after the
                        class ended. The mechanics of linear algebra weren't too
                        bad but the understanding took awhile to come to me, although
                        some 3Blue1Brown videos were very helpful for this.

						In the middle of the summer I went on a camping trip with
                        friends. We had a few adult chaperones, but they let us do
                        most of the planning - which, although last-minute and rushed,
                        I guess we did an OK job of. The trip was a good time for
                        bonding and relaxation, holding many of the feelings that I
                        think characterized my summer. The one downside was that the site had
                        swarms of flies and we ended up getting lots of bites. Although,
                        maybe this shared suffering helped us get closer together?

						Over the summer, I spent lots of time getting reacquainted
                        with the guitar I left behind at home for my freshman year
                        of college, since I thought flying it over with me to Pittsburgh 
                        wasn't worth the trouble. Even though I wasn't able to practice
                        much, I thought I got better, and it was a joy to be able
                        to sing and play the guitar again, whether by myself or with
                        other people.
